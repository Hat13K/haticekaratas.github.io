This project focuses on detecting the location of fighter jets in video frames using video segmentation and heatmap generation.

### 🎯 Objective

To create heatmaps showing the probability of aircraft presence in videos by leveraging YOLO-annotated data and customized mask generation.

---

### 🔧 Methodology

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - YOLO-annotated coordinates used as bounding boxes
  - Two types of masks were generated:
    - Gradient-based masks: circular masks centered at YOLO point
    - ROI-OTSU-based masks: elliptical thresholded regions
  - Manual correction applied every ~200 frames for accuracy

- **Modeling:**
  - Various CNN-based models tested: ResNet, EfficientNet, MobileNet, ViT
  - Best result obtained from lightweight U-Net
  - Trained model produced 30 FPS heatmap-based segmentation

- **Post-processing:**
  - Added video stabilization techniques to ensure robustness
