This project aims to develop an autonomous drone system capable of patrolling high-risk forest areas to monitor for fire threats using reinforcement learning.

### üå≤ Project Overview

- Focus: Forest fire risk monitoring via drone patrol  
- Environment: Simulated 3D forest built in Unreal Engine using AirSim plugin  
- Objective: Train a drone agent to navigate, avoid obstacles, and maintain stable patrol routes

### ü§ñ Methodology

- **Control Algorithms:**  
  - Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)  
  - Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)  
  - Transfer learning applied for policy reuse

- **Simulation:**  
  - AirSim-based environment with realistic lighting, wind, and trees  
  - Drone trained for obstacle avoidance, stability, and path-following

- **Hardware Integration:**  
  - Pixhawk flight controller  
  - Telemetry modules for bidirectional data flow  
  - Carbon fiber body design and custom 3D modeling via SolidWorks
