# 🎮 Autonomous Drone Patrol

This project aims to develop an autonomous drone system capable of patrolling high-risk forest areas to monitor for fire threats using reinforcement learning.

---
### 📝 Project Overview

- **Focus:** Forest fire risk monitoring via drone patrol  
- **Environment:** Simulated 3D forest built in Unreal Engine using AirSim plugin  
- **Objective:** Train a drone agent to navigate, avoid obstacles, and maintain stable patrol routes

### 🔧 Methodology

- **Control Algorithms:**  
  - Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)  
  - Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)  
  - Transfer learning applied for policy reuse
